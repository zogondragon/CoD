Challenge of Dragon (CoD)
=========================

A TBS game with oriental background.

Setting
-------
Challenge of Dragon (CoD) takes place in very interesting period called Yuan-Ming Transition(원명교체기, 한자). This period is generally considered from AD 1355 to AD 1368 (14 years). CoD extends this period from AD 1255 to AD 1468 (214 years) to enhance the narrative and the gameplay. In this extended Yuan-Ming Transition, the rise and fall of Chinese Middle Kingdoms and the diplomacy and the warfare between outside countries and Chinese Middle Kingdoms is richly modeled and simulated by CoD. Historical events will include extensive real history events and virtual history events. There will be many *what-if* scenarios in CoD, so it can give the players a lot of replayability.

Basic Mechanism
---------------
In contrast to many other Turn-Based Strategy (TBS) games or Strategic Role-Playing Games (SRPG), CoD is focused on *the clan* instead of *the country*. It means that you can be a clan leader such as Zhang Sanfeng(장삼봉, 한자) and change the course of history beside the curtain.

Layers
------
CoD comprises three layer of gameplay mechanism, which are the country layer, the clan layer, and the private layer. Each layer can interact with other layer to a certain degree, but the main gameplay actions are inside each layer.

In the country layer, CoD depicts strategic warfares, tactical battles, diplomacy and intrigues between kingdoms using various mathematical models and computer simulations. Choosing the side is very important for any clan because the countries will have tremendous positive and negative effects on both the clan layer and the private layer. Political marriage, alliance, betrayal, raging a city... Almost every big historical event also occurs in the country layer.

The main game actions such as clan management, clan battle, and making contracts with private companies happen in the clan layer. The player assumes the leadership of a clan. The player should manage the economic, military, political, and diplomatic aspects of the clan.
