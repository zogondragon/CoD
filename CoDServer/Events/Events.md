# Events

This document describes the event concept in CoD.

## Classification

We can classify events in CoD as follows:

### Major historical events
These events depict a critical and life-changing events such as the hegemony change(from Yuan to Ming), the assassination of a ruler, the invasion of foreign army to the Middle Kingdom, moving the capitol, and introducing new coin system.

This class of events usually have following preconditions and postconditions system:

- Some parameters are checked against the event at given time. Parameters include year, GDP, prestige of a political party or a clan, the result of a duel between very famous warriors.
- One, two or three parties can participate in the course of event. Parties can be fixed or chosen according to the stats or chosen randomly. It is different for each event.
- The result usually have 1~4 random courses. Choosing the future courses can be random or stat-driven.
- Usually, when a major historical event happens, CoD will notify detailed information about the event to the player. In most cases there will be some critical period or critical conditions for each future courses. Participants will contest for the event result because this kind of events are very huge and can be very catastrophic if it goes the wrong way. 

Clans in CoD should strategically plan their move according to major historical events. These events can be both objective and guidance to the player.

### Minor historical events
Changes such as replacing local governor or soverign does not alter the flow of the history drastically, but change many things for the clans and the average people quite well. Adjusting the tax rate by revising the tax law also can be an example.

### Major clan events
Examples:

- Birth and death of a clan (destrucion of the clan of a player means gameover for that player)
- Entrance of new disciples
- Territorial expanding of a clan
- Promotion and demotion by the ruler of a country (clans can be advisors, military consultants, and service providers for  countries - any country!)


### Natural disasters
Hurricane, earthquakes, comets and droughts! The rise and fall of the empire cannot be explained without these disasters!

### Alternative history events
These events are not real, but in most cases there are plenty of reasons to believe these happened. Especially, some oriental fantasy novel(wuxia, 무협) written by writers described many historical events in other ways. The most famous example of this is 장무기 and 주원장 in 의천도룡기(The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber, 1961).
